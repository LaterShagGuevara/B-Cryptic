### B-Cryptic Encoding Rules

- Lowercase letters are mapped to randomized encrypted values (e.g., `hello` → `[24328P3X][6377K51Q][511E4R13]...`)
- Capital letters are uniquely encoded (e.g., `Hello` → `[^Z95J6685][6377K51Q]...`)
- Numbers are mapped to unique encrypted values (e.g., `123` → `[62U541T4][9H6398R4][I19B5335]`)
- Symbols have special encoded representations
- Spaces are preserved between words
